 *
 * Register a callback for an event.
 *
 * Parameters:

 *  event - the event to register a callback for. Can be one of:
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_RELOAD
 *              Called when the broker is sent a signal indicating it should
 *              reload its configuration.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_ACL_CHECK
 *              Called when a publish/subscribe/unsubscribe command is received
 *              and the broker wants to check when the client is allowed to carry
 *              out this command.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_BASIC_AUTH
 *              Called when a client connects to the broker, to allow the
 *              username/password/clientid to be authenticated.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_EXT_AUTH_START
 *              Called when an MQTT v5 client connects, if it is using extended
 *              authentication.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_EXT_AUTH_CONTINUE
 *              Called when an MQTT v5 client connects, if it is using extended
 *              authentication.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_CONTROL
 *              Called on receipt of a $CONTROL message that the plugin has
 *              registered for.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_MESSAGE_IN
 *              Called for each incoming PUBLISH message after it has been received
 *              and authorised. The contents of the message can be modified.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_MESSAGE_OUT
 *              Called for each outgoing PUBLISH message after it has been authorised,
 *              but before it is sent to each subscribing client. The contents of the
 *              message can be modified.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PSK_KEY
 *              Called when a client connects with TLS-PSK and the broker needs
 *              the PSK information.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_TICK
 *              Called periodically by the broker. The next_s and next_ms
 *              values of the event data can be used to set a minimum interval
 *              that the broker will wait before calling the tick event again
 *              for this callback.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_DISCONNECT
 *              Called when a client disconnects from the broker.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_CONNECT
 *              Called when a client has successfully connected to the broker,
 *              i.e. has been authenticated.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_SUBSCRIBE
 *              Called when a client has made a successful subscription
 *              request, but before the subscription is applied. The
 *              subscription request can be modified, although this is not
 *              recommended.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_UNSUBSCRIBE
 *              Called when a client has made a successful unsubscription
 *              request, but before the unsubscription is applied. The
 *              unsubscription request can be modified, although this is not
 *              recommended.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_RESTORE
 *              Called on startup when a persistence plugin should restore
 *              persistence data.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_BASE_MSG_ADD
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must add a base message to its
 *              store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_BASE_MSG_DELETE
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must delete a base message
 *              from its store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_RETAIN_MSG_SET
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must set or update a retained
 *              message in its store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_RETAIN_MSG_DELETE
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must delete a retained message
 *              from its store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_CLIENT_ADD
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must add a client session to
 *              its store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_CLIENT_DELETE
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must delete a client session
 *              from its store.
 *          * MOSQ_EVT_PERSIST_CLIENT_UPDATE
 *              Called when a persistence plugin must update a client session

 *              Called when a persistence plugin must delete a client

 *
 * It can be used to send messages to all clients that have a matching

 *
 * Parameters:
 *  clientid -   optional string. If set to NULL, the message is delivered to all
 *               clients. If non-NULL, the message is delivered only to the

 *  topic -      message topic
 *  payloadlen - payload length in bytes. Can be 0 for an empty payload.
 *  payload -    payload bytes. If payloadlen > 0 this must not be NULL. Must
 *               be allocated on the heap. Will be freed by mosquitto after use if the
 *               function returns success.
 *  qos -        message QoS to use.

 * id and the result.
 *
 * Result:
 *  MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS - the client successfully authenticated
 *  MOSQ_ERR_AUTH - the client authentication failed
 *
 * Other error codes can be used if more appropriate, and the client connection
 * will still be rejected, e.g. MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM.
